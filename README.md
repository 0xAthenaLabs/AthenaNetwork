# Athena Network
Athena is a decentralized cloud system that has been meticulously designed to offer maximum security and reliability, while also delivering high network throughput performance. The platform leverages an external peer-to-peer network, which allows it to operate independently of the payment processing blockchain (initially built on Ethereum, but with plans to expand to other platforms shortly). This careful approach eliminates the need for trust in the reliability of the payment processors, setting it apart from other solutions that rely on centralized authorities. To ensure top-notch security and privacy for its users, the Athena software relies on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key-based encryption and data compression. These measures ensure that all files stored on the platform are protected and can only be accessed by authorized users. Furthermore, the high-performance capabilities of the platform ensure that users can access their files with ease and efficiency, regardless of their location or device. Athena is an excellent alternative to centralized cloud solutions that come with inherent limitations and risks. The platform offers a decentralized approach to cloud storage that provides greater security, privacy, and flexibility. With a user-focused approach and a commitment to meeting the needs of the worldwide public, Athena is rapidly emerging as a serious competitor in the cloud storage space. Whether you are an individual, a small business owner, or a large enterprise, The proposed solution has the potential to revolutionize the way you store and access your data in a more secure, reliable, and high-performing manner.Athena is a decentralized cloud system that has been meticulously designed to offer maximum security and reliability, while also delivering high network throughput performance.
